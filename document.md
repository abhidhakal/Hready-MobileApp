## Technical Architecture

Design Pattern Implementation
HReady employs the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, ensuring clear separation of concerns:

Model Layer: Business logic implementation and data models
View Layer: Flutter widgets responsible for UI rendering and user interaction
ViewModel Layer: BLoC (Business Logic Component) classes managing state and business logic

Clean Architecture Principles
The application follows clean architecture principles with distinct layer separation:

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Presentation Layer        │
│  (UI, ViewModels, BLoC Components)  │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│            Domain Layer             │
│    (Entities, Use Cases, Repositories) │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│             Data Layer              │
│  (Repositories, Data Sources, Hive) │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

State Management Strategy
The application utilizes BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management, providing:
Reactive Programming: Automatic UI updates based on state changes
Predictable State Flow: Unidirectional data flow ensuring consistency
